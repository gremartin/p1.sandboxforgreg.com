	<p>I am originally from Thomaston, CT.  I graduated from Boston College
	 with a degree in Music and currently work at MCPHS University (formerly the Massachusetts 
	 College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences) in Boston.  I earned an undergraduate certificate
	 in software development from Boston University's Metropolitan College in 2010 and started
	 studying Web Design last fall in MassArt's Continuing Education program.</p>
	<p>In my spare time, I play double bass with several jazz groups and the Brookline Symphony Orchestra, 
	and guitar whenever I can.</p>
